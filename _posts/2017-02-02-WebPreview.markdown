If you have visited our blog since the last three days, you could have notice a new button on the main page of the blog. Yes, you don't dream : it is a working web version of the application.
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}
I know it is a bit limited because it is a MVP and the web version doesn't allow some things such as :
- notification
- switching application (for example google map)
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}


Please visit the link below to access the early version. (Access Web Preview)[https://whispyy.github.io/whispyy/FeelLillePreview/]
