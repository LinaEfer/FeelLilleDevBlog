Welcome to the dedicated blog for the development of the FeelLille project.
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"}
In this blog we will share our knowledge and conduct a discution on the project. In order to make you travel into the new world of mobile application development. We will also share our experiences and technical solutions, which are in the process of developing our application. We hope that our experience will be useful to our readers!

Letâ€™s start! 
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}

At the moment, we have identified the main way to structure the project by using agile management. Then we will start by listing the first steps of the chosen process :
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}
* Visit Lille tourists' office to ask their database for our project (this could be an advantage in order to have the most diverse list of events and locations)
* Search more different databases like the RSS flux of [lille.fr](http://www.lille.fr)
* Design of application mockup by using the online-resource like [ninjamock.com](http://www.ninjamock.com) or [app.moqups.com](http://www.app.moqups.com) or by using classic sketchbook (the main objective of this step is to create a clear picture of how an application should look like)
* Choice of development environment ([Ionic frameworks](http://ionicframework.com/) or [Android](https://developer.android.com/index.html))
* We also want to use a NoSql database (like [FirebaseDB](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) or CouchDB/PouchDB)
