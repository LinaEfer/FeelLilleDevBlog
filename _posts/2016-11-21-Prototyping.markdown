## Prototyping, what is it ?

Prototyping is the creation of layout model for the future application in order to determine the correct structure of Its functionality and, overall the conception. If an application is developed by a third-part, a prototype could be shown to the client. In this case he could monitor and propose adjustments to the application.

Prototype has a wonderful property to eliminate misunderstandings between different parts (manager, director, designer, programmer, client) involved in the project to organize thoughts, prevent mistakes and unnecessary work in early steps of development. We can test the future application by using a focus group, that will help us to get useful information and feedback from the future users.

## Prototyping in our project

For our project we used “Justinmind Prototyper”.
This tool allows us to create interactive prototypes of websites and applications for iPhone, Android and iPad. It supports many features, including work with gestures (e.g Drag & Drop etc).
Unfortunately, free version is limited : only linking the templates and 10 MB of space in the cloud is available. But there is a trial for 30 days.

Here is mains functionality of our application:
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}



<img src="../../../../assets/posts/1prototype.gif" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin-left: 10px;">Provision of relevant information to the user on the home page. We decided to add to the homepage some intuitive elements :
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}
- Poster with the image of the event
- Ability to share event
- Rating event
- Adding notes section

Also, we will present the menu-bar, which is locked to the right or left side on screen, depending on whether the page is displayed. To return to the main page, users has just to click on the "Main Menu". <br />
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}


<img src="../../../../assets/posts/2prototype.gif" style="float: left; width: 40%; margin-right: 10px;"><br /><br /><br />Ability to search for interesting events by categories. Users must select the "Category" button in the menu bar, which is moved to the right edge of the screen and open a list of available categories to search for.
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}
There, users could choose their interest category to view current events. <br /><br /><br /><br />
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}

<img src="../../../../assets/posts/3prototype.gif" style="float: right; width: 40%;  margin-left: 10px;"><br /><br /><br />Also, we found interesting to add the ability to configure the event selection.
{: style="text-align: justify; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif"}

There is a separate section on calendar, where users could set the day and display events for this day. There’s also the possibility to use the advanced selection, i.e., selection by period, cost and type of event...etc<br /><br /><br /><br />
