In order to stay on track, it is now time to care about Front-end Services to retrieve data from Back-End. After doing it we will care about developing controllers and views parts.

That is why we built a scheme of the linking structure. The goal is to build a service's hierarchy and to start implementing it as fast as we can.

Before starting it we already knew that we need a user manager service that is why, while I am doing this structuration, Vasilina has started working on the Authentification Service to win time.

So to conclude I put there a scheme to illustrate the current modelisation of services. It is not the final one because we are waiting for validation of it by our coach.

On the scheme you have at the top the activity where services will be used. An activity is equivalent at a page for ionic and angular. And at the bottom you have the name of the table services need to pull datas.
