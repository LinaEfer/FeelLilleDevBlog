Read the [first article](/FeelLilleDevBlog/feellille/2016/11/21/Prototyping.html), which is about the creation of prototypes.

After being established concept (prototype) before our team came a clear visual representation of the future project. But now we need to choose the style of the application. And it can also be done in different ways.

The most widespread and, in my opinion, the most correct way is experiments. Advantages of this method: the ability to generate a lot of options. Disadvantage - time, but is generally justified. Then, according to certain criteria and cut off the unnecessary - choose the best option.

Last week, design-students group was invited to participate in the development process and share their experiences. The guys listened attentively to the brief presentation and began to actively propose a variety of ideas to improve the projects.

So what is color? And how important is color in design?
To little clarify this issue, we will conduct a brief introduction to the course  in color theory.
A good color solution is half of the project's  success. To help  developing designers I prepared a little color wheel theory and a collection of links to useful resources.

According to color theory, harmonious combination used: two colors opposite each other; all three colors are uniformly distributed around the circle and forming a triangle; any four colors forming a rectangle (actually, two pairs of opposing colors).

First we need to defined a range of general colors. Prepare the color palette. Palettes can be selected in various ways: for example the color of the reference design; or apply on the color wheel filter. You can compose a custom palette. The main thing to adhere to a given direction.
